**Requirements: Rewrite a Python script for data processing in Rust, highlighting the improvements in speed and resource usage.**


## Project Description
Word Counter Command-Line Tool in <i> Rust </i> and <i> Python </i>

This is a simple command-line tool that counts the number of words in a text file.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository or download the source code.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Install the package in editable mode:

```bash
# Python Version
pip3 install -e .

# Rust Version
cd rust-package
cargo install --path .
```

## Usage

To count words in a text file, use the following command:
```bash
# Python Version
word_counter <path_to_text_file>

# Rust Version
word_counter_rust <path_to_text_file>
```

e.g., count the word count in ```test.txt```

To see the guide, run
```bash
word_counter --help
```

## Result
For the Python version, the first time running the program, it takes unbelievable ```4.707080``` seconds to count the word in test.txt. Though the second time it's much faster: ```0.000038``` second, compared to the Rust version, it's still much slower.
